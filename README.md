# Real-Time Data Processing (Retail)

Real-time data processing offers significant advantages over batch processing, especially in the context of rapidly evolving technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), online transactions, and social media. Streaming data pipelines play a pivotal role in modern data architectures, specifically designed to handle continuous data streams with the primary goal of facilitating timely decision-making based on the latest information.

From my experience, streaming data dashboards serve as invaluable sources of real-time insights, enabling businesses to make prompt decisions based on current data. This approach not only allows for the monitoring and control of fundamental aspects of the business but also fosters further data analytics initiatives aimed at optimizing business operations.

The example provided here showcases streaming data related to sales in a fictional company with ten regional stores. The first section of the dashboard displays real-time sales per square foot across product categories for the entire company, accompanied by essential retail key performance indicators (KPIs). In the second section, viewers can observe streaming sales per square foot across product categories for each individual store, along with the sales share attributed to each store, all updated in real time.
